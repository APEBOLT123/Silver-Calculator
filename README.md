## About The Size Of The Exe.

I used PyInstaller to compile it, for some reason it made a very basic file 35 MB,
Maybe over the icon but im not sure.
Sorry.

## Virus Total.

PyInstaller makes Virus Total and other detectors detect a virus within the app,
I promise its not and theres documentation about this issue online.

## Would Love Some Feedback!
